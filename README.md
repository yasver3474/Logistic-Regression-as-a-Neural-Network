Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset.
This repository focusses on Image Classification with Logistic Regression.
But the logistic regression unit has been built from scratch and has been thought of as Neural Network with input as pixels of an image and no hidden units. And the neural network outputs a class (0-Cats,1-Dogs) for an input image. 
The dataset used is the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset.
